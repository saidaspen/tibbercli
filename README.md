# Tibbi
> Small and opinionated CLI for the Tibber API.

Tibber is great, but did you know that they have an API that is useable by anyone? 
TibberCLI aims to let you access some of the data (prices and usage) directly from your command line.

It is also worth mentioning that this project is not yet functioning. It is, as we would have said in the nineties, Under Construction.
